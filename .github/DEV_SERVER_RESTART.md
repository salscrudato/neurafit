# ðŸ”§ Dev Server Restart Required

## Issue Fixed

The COOP (Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy) error you're seeing is because:
1. The production COOP headers were being applied in development
2. Vite's dependency cache was outdated

## What Was Fixed

âœ… **Updated `vite.config.ts`** to disable COOP in development:
```typescript
server: {
  headers: {
    'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'unsafe-none',
    'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'unsafe-none',
  },
}
```

âœ… **Cleared Vite cache** - All cached dependencies removed

## Action Required

**Stop your current dev server and restart it:**

### Option 1: Terminal
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop the current dev server
# Then run:
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: VS Code
1. Find the terminal running `npm run dev`
2. Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac)
3. Run `npm run dev` again

## Why This Happened

- The COOP headers we added for production (to fix Firebase Auth popups) were also being applied in development
- In development, we need `unsafe-none` to allow popups
- In production, Firebase Hosting applies the correct headers from `firebase.json`

## Verification

After restarting the dev server, you should see:
- âœ… No COOP errors in console
- âœ… Firebase Auth popup works correctly
- âœ… No "Outdated Optimize Dep" errors
- âœ… Dashboard loads without errors

## If Issues Persist

If you still see errors after restarting:

```bash
# 1. Stop dev server (Ctrl+C)
# 2. Clear all caches
npm run clean:cache
# 3. Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

## Production Not Affected

This only affects local development. Production deployment at https://neurastack.ai is working correctly with proper COOP headers.
