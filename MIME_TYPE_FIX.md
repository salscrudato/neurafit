# MIME Type Error Fix - Component Error Resolution

## Issue
Users on mobile devices were seeing a "Component Error" with the message:
```
'text/html' is not a valid JavaScript MIME type.
```

Error ID: `err_1760622521011_6sylyf v0p`

## Root Cause
The service worker was attempting to precache HTML files (including `index.html`) as if they were JavaScript modules. Workbox's precaching mechanism is designed for static assets like JS, CSS, and images - not for HTML navigation files.

When the browser tried to load a precached HTML file as a module, it failed with the MIME type error because HTML files have `Content-Type: text/html`, not `application/javascript`.

## Solution
Modified the service worker build configuration to:

1. **Remove HTML from precache list**
   - Removed `'**/*.html'` from `globPatterns`
   - Now only precaches: JS, CSS, images, and manifest.json

2. **Add network-first runtime caching for HTML**
   - Added new runtime caching strategy for HTML files
   - Uses `NetworkFirst` handler with 5-second timeout
   - Falls back to cache if network unavailable
   - Maintains offline support for app shell

## Changes Made

### File: `scripts/build-sw.js`

**Before:**
```javascript
globPatterns: [
  '**/*.html',           // ❌ Caused MIME type error
  '**/*.js',
  '**/*.css',
  '**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg,ico,webp}',
  'manifest.json',
],
```

**After:**
```javascript
globPatterns: [
  '**/*.js',             // ✅ Only static assets
  '**/*.css',
  '**/*.{png,jpg,jpeg,gif,svg,ico,webp}',
  'manifest.json',
],

runtimeCaching: [
  // Network-first for HTML navigation (app shell)
  {
    urlPattern: /\.html$/,
    handler: 'NetworkFirst',
    options: {
      cacheName: 'html-pages',
      networkTimeoutSeconds: 5,
      expiration: {
        maxEntries: 10,
        maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24, // 24 hours
      },
    },
  },
  // ... other strategies
],
```

## How It Works Now

### HTML File Serving
1. **First request**: Network-first strategy tries to fetch from network
2. **Network available**: Serves fresh HTML from server
3. **Network timeout (5s)**: Falls back to cached version
4. **Network unavailable**: Serves cached HTML for offline support
5. **Cache updated**: New HTML cached for future offline use

### Benefits
✅ **No MIME type errors** - HTML not treated as JavaScript
✅ **Always fresh** - Network-first ensures latest version
✅ **Offline support** - Falls back to cache when offline
✅ **Fast fallback** - 5-second timeout prevents long waits
✅ **Proper caching** - HTML cached separately from JS/CSS

## Service Worker Changes

**Precached files**: Reduced from 47 to 44 files
- Removed: `index.html`, `clear-cache.html`, `googlef555ff34ebaf47b2.html`
- These are now handled by runtime caching strategy

**New cache**: `html-pages`
- Stores up to 10 HTML files
- Expires after 24 hours
- Uses network-first strategy

## Testing

### Before Fix
- ❌ Mobile users saw "Component Error"
- ❌ MIME type error in console
- ❌ App failed to load

### After Fix
- ✅ App loads successfully
- ✅ No MIME type errors
- ✅ HTML served via network-first
- ✅ Offline support maintained
- ✅ Cache busting still works

## Deployment

**Commit**: `73d8709`
**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Deployed to Firebase

### Files Modified
- `scripts/build-sw.js` - Updated precache and runtime caching config

### Build Output
```
✅ Service worker built successfully!
   📦 Precached 44 files (was 47)
   💾 Total size: 1.28 MB
   🎯 Strategies: Cache-First (static), SWR (API), Network-First (HTML)
```

## Verification

To verify the fix is working:

1. **Check Service Worker**
   - Open DevTools > Application > Service Workers
   - Verify SW is registered and active

2. **Check Cache Storage**
   - Open DevTools > Application > Cache Storage
   - Look for `html-pages` cache
   - Should contain HTML files

3. **Check Network Tab**
   - Load app
   - HTML requests should show network requests
   - Should not show MIME type errors

4. **Test Offline**
   - Go offline in DevTools
   - Refresh page
   - Should load from cache

## Related Changes

This fix complements the cache busting system implemented in commit `490f78f`:
- Version detection still works
- Cache invalidation still works
- Update notifications still work
- Now with proper HTML handling

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Test on mobile devices
2. ✅ Monitor Sentry for errors
3. ✅ Verify offline functionality
4. ✅ Check cache hit rates

## Status

🎉 **FIX COMPLETE AND DEPLOYED**

The MIME type error is resolved. Users should now see the app load successfully without component errors.
