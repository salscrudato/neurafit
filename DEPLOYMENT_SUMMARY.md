## ðŸ“Š Key Improvements

### Quality Metrics
| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Min Overall Score | 80 | 82 | +2 |
| Min Safety Score | 85 | 88 | +3 |
| Repair Attempts | 0 | 1 | +1 |
| Safety Weight | 35% | 40% | +5% |
| Timeout | 150s | 120s | -30s |

### Code Changes
- **Modified Files**: 3
  - `functions/src/config.ts` - Optimized OpenAI configuration
  - `functions/src/index.ts` - Enhanced function setup
  - `functions/src/workout/generation.ts` - Improved validation logic

- **New Files**: 2
  - `functions/src/lib/promptBuilder.enhanced.ts` - Enhanced prompt system
  - `functions/src/lib/qualityScoring.ts` - Improved quality scoring

## ðŸš€ Deployed Functions

All three Firebase Cloud Functions successfully deployed and verified:

1. **generateWorkout** - AI-powered personalized workout generation
   - URL: https://generateworkout-5zdm7qwt5a-uc.a.run.app
   - Status: âœ… Active & Verified
   - Latest: Successfully generating workouts with new quality scoring

2. **addExerciseToWorkout** - Add exercises to existing workouts
   - URL: https://addexercisetoworkout-5zdm7qwt5a-uc.a.run.app
   - Status: âœ… Active & Verified

3. **swapExercise** - Swap exercises with contextual matching
   - URL: https://swapexercise-5zdm7qwt5a-uc.a.run.app
   - Status: âœ… Active & Verified

**Deployment Note**: Initial 500 error was due to old code not having new files. After clean rebuild and redeploy, all functions are working correctly with the enhanced quality scoring and prompt engineering.
