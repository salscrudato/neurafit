## 🚀 Deployment Status: COMPLETE ✅

### Firebase Functions Deployed
- ✅ All 16 subscription functions deployed successfully
- ✅ Enhanced webhook processing with email lookup fallback
- ✅ Improved error handling and retry logic

### Firebase Hosting Deployed
- ✅ Frontend built and deployed to production
- ✅ All subscription components updated
- ✅ Enhanced payment form with better error handling

## 🔧 Key Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Webhook Processing
**Problem:** Subscription status wasn't persisting because webhook couldn't find users by customer ID.

**Solution:** 
- Enhanced `getUserByCustomerId` function with email lookup fallback
- Added automatic customer ID mapping to user profiles
- Improved error handling with detailed logging

### 2. Profile Persistence Improvements
**Changes Made:**
- Webhook now looks up users by email if customer ID not found
- Automatically updates user profiles with customer ID for future lookups
- Ensures `freeWorkoutLimit: 10` is set consistently
- Better error messages for debugging

### 3. Subscription Data Consistency
**Enhancements:**
- All webhook handlers now include `customerId` in profile updates
- Consistent `freeWorkoutLimit: 10` across all subscription events
- Enhanced logging for better monitoring

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Webhook Functionality: ✅ WORKING
- ✅ Customer events processed successfully
- ✅ Invoice events handled correctly
- ✅ Enhanced error handling for missing users
- ✅ Automatic retry logic for transient failures

### Expected Behavior:
1. **New Subscription Flow:**
   - User creates payment intent → Customer ID stored in profile
   - Stripe processes payment → Webhook updates subscription status
   - Profile automatically updated with active subscription

2. **Webhook Resilience:**
   - If customer ID not found, looks up by email
   - Automatically maps customer ID to user profile
   - Retries failed operations with exponential backoff
