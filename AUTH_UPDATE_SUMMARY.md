## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Existing Email/Password Users:

If you have existing users who signed up with email/password:

1. **They can no longer sign in with email/password**
2. **Options for them:**
   - Sign in with Google (if same email)
   - Sign in with Phone (new account)
   - Contact support for account migration

3. **Migration Strategy (if needed):**
   - Keep email/password auth temporarily
   - Send email to all users about the change
   - Give them time to link Google/Phone to their account
   - Then remove email/password auth

### Recommendation:
If you have existing email/password users, consider:
1. Adding a migration period
2. Sending notification emails
3. Allowing account linking
4. Or keeping email/password auth alongside Google/Phone

## 📱 Production URLs

### Live App:
- **Primary:** https://neurafit-ai-2025.web.app
- **Console:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/neurafit-ai-2025/overview

### Authentication Settings:
- **Google:** Enabled ✅
- **Phone:** Enabled ✅
- **Email/Password:** Still enabled in Firebase (but not in UI)

**Note:** Email/password is still enabled in Firebase Console, so existing users' accounts still exist. They just can't sign in through the UI anymore.

## 🔄 Rollback Plan

If you need to restore email/password authentication:

### Quick Rollback:
```bash
# Checkout previous commit
git log --oneline  # Find the commit before this change
git checkout <commit-hash>

# Rebuild and redeploy
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

### Or Manually Re-add:
1. Add back email/password form in `src/pages/Auth.tsx`
2. Add back validation functions
3. Add back email/password state
4. Add back imports
5. Rebuild and redeploy

## 📊 Analytics Impact

### Events to Monitor:
- `user_signup` with method: `google` or `phone`

- No more `email` method events

### Expected Changes:
- Increase in Google sign-ins (easier)

- Overall sign-up rate may increase (simpler flow)
