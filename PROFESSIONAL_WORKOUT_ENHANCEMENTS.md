### 4. Workout Quality Scoring System (`workoutQualityScorer.ts`)

**Quality Metrics (0-100 scale)**:
- **Programming** (20%): Evidence-based set/rep/rest schemes
- **Safety** (25%): Injury prevention and contraindications
- **Progression** (15%): Appropriate difficulty scaling
- **Balance** (15%): Movement pattern and muscle group balance
- **Specificity** (15%): Goal alignment and exercise selection
- **Feasibility** (10%): Time and equipment constraints

**Quality Thresholds**:
- 90+: Excellent (professional standard)
- 80-89: Good (minor improvements needed)
- 70-79: Acceptable (needs refinement)
- <70: Below standard (significant improvements needed)

### 5. Professional Coaching Context (`promptEnhancements.ts`)

**Experience-Based Coaching**:
- **Beginner**: Movement quality focus, detailed cues, 2-3 sets max
- **Intermediate**: Progressive overload, technique refinement, 3-4 sets
- **Advanced**: Complex patterns, high intensity, 3-6 sets with variations

**Goal-Specific Coaching**:
- **Strength**: Compound movements, 3-6 reps, longer rest
- **Hypertrophy**: 6-12 reps, mind-muscle connection, mixed exercises
- **Fat Loss**: Circuit training, shorter rest, metabolic focus
- **Endurance**: Higher reps (12-20+), cardio intervals, efficiency focus

**Injury-Specific Modifications**:
- Knee: Avoid deep flexion, provide alternatives
- Back: Neutral spine emphasis, core activation
- Shoulder: Range of motion modifications, stability work

### 6. Enhanced JSON Schema

**New Fields Added**:
```typescript
{
  "muscleGroups": string[],          // For programming balance
  "difficulty": string,              // "beginner" | "intermediate" | "advanced"
  "workoutSummary": {
    "totalVolume": string,           // Brief volume description
    "primaryFocus": string,          // Main training stimulus
    "expectedRPE": string            // Rate of perceived exertion
  }
}
```

**Enhanced Descriptions**:
- 4-6 sentences minimum
- Setup, execution, key cues, breathing pattern
- Beginner-friendly language
- Biomechanical accuracy

### 7. Professional Safety Standards

**Injury Contraindications**:
- Knee injuries: Avoid deep squats, lunges, high-impact
- Lower back: Avoid spinal flexion under load, heavy overhead
- Shoulder: Avoid overhead pressing with impingement history
- Ankle: Modify jumping/plyometric movements
- Wrist: Provide alternatives to weight-bearing positions

**Form and Safety Requirements**:
- 2-3 critical technique cues per exercise
- 2-3 injury prevention tips per exercise
- Modification options for all experience levels
- Pain-free range of motion emphasis

### 8. Evidence-Based Programming

**Workout Structure Requirements**:
- 3-5 minutes dynamic warm-up (sessions >20 min)
- Logical exercise progression (compound â†’ isolation)
- 2-3 minutes cool-down/mobility (sessions >30 min)
- Balanced muscle groups and movement patterns

**Rest Period Guidelines**:
- Strength: 120-300 seconds
- Hypertrophy: 60-120 seconds
- Endurance: 30-60 seconds
- Warm-up: 15-45 seconds
- Cool-down: 30-90 seconds

### 9. Quality Monitoring and Feedback

**Real-Time Validation**:
- Workouts with critical safety issues are rejected
- Quality scores below 60 trigger warnings
- Validation errors and warnings logged for monitoring

**User Feedback Integration**:
- Quality scores and recommendations included in response
- Validation warnings displayed to users
- Continuous improvement through quality metrics

### 10. Professional Language and Tone
