## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-09

### iOS PWA Layout & Safe Area Fixes üì±

#### Critical iOS PWA Issues Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Fixed Top Content Cut-off**: Resolved issue where content was hidden behind iPhone status bar/notch in PWA mode
  - Changed `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` from `black-translucent` to `default` to prevent status bar overlay
  - Added proper safe area insets to root container (`#root`) to respect iOS notch and status bar
  - Removed redundant inline safe-area styles from header components (now handled at root level)
- **Fixed Bottom Whitespace**: Corrected viewport height handling to eliminate unwanted whitespace at bottom
  - Updated body and html styling to use `-webkit-fill-available` for proper iOS viewport height
  - Removed `position: fixed` from body that was causing layout issues
  - Added safe area padding to root container for consistent spacing

#### Enhanced Safe Area Support üéØ
- **Comprehensive Safe Area CSS Classes**: Added new utility classes for iOS safe areas
  - `.safe-top`, `.safe-bottom`, `.safe-left`, `.safe-right` - Direct safe area padding
  - `.safe-mt`, `.safe-mb` - Safe area margins for specific use cases
  - `.fixed-bottom-safe`, `.fixed-top-safe` - For fixed positioned elements
- **Applied Safe Area Classes**: Updated all fixed bottom elements to use new safe area classes
  - Workout Preview page: Start button now respects bottom safe area
  - Exercise page: Control buttons properly positioned above iOS home indicator
  - Onboarding page: Navigation footer respects bottom safe area
- **Root-Level Safe Area Handling**: Implemented safe area insets at the root container level
  - All safe area insets (top, bottom, left, right) applied to `#root` element
  - Ensures consistent spacing across all pages without per-component configuration

#### Mobile Viewport Improvements üìê
- **Enhanced Viewport Meta Tag**: Already had `viewport-fit=cover` for proper iOS safe area support
- **Improved CSS Viewport Handling**:
  - Updated `.min-h-screen-mobile` class with flexbox for better content distribution
  - Added `-webkit-fill-available` support for iOS viewport height issues
  - Improved body positioning to `relative` instead of `fixed` for better scrolling
- **Better Text Rendering**: Added `-webkit-text-size-adjust: 100%` to prevent iOS font size adjustments

#### Technical Implementation
- Modified `index.html`:
  - Changed status bar style from `black-translucent` to `default` (line 34)
  - Updated inline styles for html, body, and #root with proper safe area support (lines 236-303)
- Modified `src/index.css`:
  - Enhanced `.min-h-screen-mobile` class with flexbox (lines 41-56)
  - Added comprehensive safe area utility classes (lines 104-158)
  - Improved body styling with iOS-specific fixes (lines 149-162)
- Modified `src/App.tsx`:
  - Changed main container from `min-h-screen` to `min-h-screen-mobile` (line 91)

  - `src/components/AppHeader.tsx`: Removed inline safe-area-inset-top style (line 73)
  - `src/components/WorkoutFlowHeader.tsx`: Removed inline safe-area-inset-top style (line 83)
  - `src/pages/workout/Exercise.tsx`: Changed to use `.fixed-bottom-safe` class (line 458)
  - `src/pages/workout/Preview.tsx`: Added `.fixed-bottom-safe` class (line 225)
