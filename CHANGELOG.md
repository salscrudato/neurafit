## [1.0.5] - 2025-10-09

### Critical Horizontal Scrolling Fix üîí

#### Issue Resolved ‚úÖ
- **Fixed horizontal scrolling bug**: Menu was opening outside viewport causing unwanted horizontal scroll
- **Root cause**: Safe area padding on #root combined with fixed positioning caused overflow
- **Impact**: Users could scroll horizontally and see content outside the intended viewport

#### Implementation Details
- **Global overflow prevention**: Added `overflow-x: hidden` to html, body, and #root
- **Max-width constraints**: Applied `max-width: 100vw` to prevent any element from exceeding viewport
- **Menu positioning fixes**: Updated all dropdown menus to respect safe areas and viewport bounds
  - AppHeader menu: Added `max-w-[calc(100vw-2rem)]` and safe-area-aware positioning
  - WorkoutFlowHeader menu: Same treatment for consistency
  - Dashboard error toast: Constrained to viewport with safe area support
  - UpdateToast: Added viewport constraints for mobile
- **New CSS utilities**: Created `.fixed-safe-right` and `.fixed-safe-left` classes for reusable safe positioning

#### Files Modified
- `index.html`: Added overflow-x prevention to html, body, and #root (lines 250-292)
- `src/index.css`: Added global overflow prevention and new utility classes (lines 1-32, 168-191)
- `src/components/AppHeader.tsx`: Fixed menu positioning with safe areas (lines 113-122)
- `src/components/WorkoutFlowHeader.tsx`: Fixed menu positioning (lines 204-210)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: Fixed error toast positioning (lines 443-451)
- `src/hooks/useUpdateToast.tsx`: Added viewport constraints (lines 74-82)

#### Technical Approach
- **Defensive CSS**: Multiple layers of overflow prevention (html ‚Üí body ‚Üí #root)
- **Safe area integration**: All fixed elements now use `max(1rem, env(safe-area-inset-right))` pattern
- **Viewport-relative sizing**: Used `calc(100vw - 2rem)` to ensure elements fit within viewport
- **Professional solution**: Reusable utility classes for future fixed/absolute positioned elements

#### Testing Recommendations
- Test menu opening on narrow viewports (iPhone SE, small Android phones)
- Verify no horizontal scrolling on any page
- Check that menus don't get cut off on devices with safe areas
- Test on both iOS PWA and mobile browser

## [1.0.4] - 2025-10-09

  - `src/components/AppHeader.tsx`: Removed inline safe-area-inset-top style (line 73)
  - `src/components/WorkoutFlowHeader.tsx`: Removed inline safe-area-inset-top style (line 83)
  - `src/pages/workout/Exercise.tsx`: Changed to use `.fixed-bottom-safe` class (line 458)
  - `src/pages/workout/Preview.tsx`: Added `.fixed-bottom-safe` class (line 225)
