## 🎯 Phases Completed

### Phase 1: Consolidate Prompts & Remove Quality Scoring ✅
- **Merged** 3 prompt builder files into 1 unified system
- **Removed** `promptBuilder.enhanced.ts`, `promptEnhancements.ts`
- **Eliminated** `qualityScoring.ts` (informational only, no gating)
- **Result**: Simpler, more maintainable prompt system

### Phase 2: Simplify Validation & Duration Handling ✅
- **Replaced** multi-pass validation with single pass + 1 retry
- **Simplified** duration variance to ±10% for all workouts
- **Removed** complex duration adjustment logic
- **Removed** periodization Firestore reads
- **Result**: Faster, more reliable generation

### Phase 3: Remove Caching Layer ✅
- **Deleted** `cache.ts` and Firestore caching dependency
- **Removed** cache configuration from `config.ts`
- **Result**: Reduced latency, simpler code
