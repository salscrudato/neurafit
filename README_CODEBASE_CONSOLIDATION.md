- Verification results
- Benefits for developers and AI agents

## Usage

### For Human Developers

**Quick Reference:**
```bash
# View the entire codebase
cat neurafit-codebase.txt

# Search for specific code
grep -n "function name" neurafit-codebase.txt

# View specific section
sed -n '/SECTION 1: FRONTEND/,/SECTION 2: BACKEND/p' neurafit-codebase.txt

# Count lines of code
wc -l neurafit-codebase.txt
```

**Regenerate After Changes:**
```bash
./consolidate-codebase.sh
```

### For AI Coding Agents

The consolidated file is optimized for AI consumption:

1. **Load the entire codebase:**
   - Single file makes it easy to load all code into context
   - Clear file separators help identify individual files
   - Table of contents provides overview

2. **Navigate by section:**
   - Frontend code: Lines 30-14394
   - Backend code: Lines 14395-16500
   - Configuration: Lines 16501-18382

3. **Search for specific files:**
   ```
   Search for: "FILE: src/components/Loading.tsx"
   ```

4. **Understand structure:**
   - Read the table of contents (lines 6-28)
   - Each file is clearly marked with separators
   - Path is included in file header

## File Format

Each file in the consolidated codebase follows this format:

```
========================================
FILE: path/to/file.tsx
========================================

[file contents here]

```

## Statistics

- **Total Files:** 87
- **Total Lines:** 18,382
- **Frontend Files:** 64
- **Backend Files:** 9
- **Config Files:** 11
- **File Size:** 654 KB

## Maintenance

### When to Regenerate

Regenerate the consolidated file when:
- New files are added
- Files are renamed or moved
- Major code changes are made
- Before sharing with team members
- Before code reviews

### How to Regenerate

```bash
./consolidate-codebase.sh
```

The script will automatically:
1. Find all source files
2. Organize by category
3. Add separators and headers
4. Generate statistics
5. Create new consolidated file

## Notes

- The consolidated file is **read-only** for reference
- Always edit the original source files, not the consolidated file
- Regenerate after significant changes
- The file is excluded from version control (add to .gitignore if needed)
- Safe to delete and regenerate anytime

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check `CODEBASE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` for details
2. Review the consolidation script
3. Regenerate the file if it seems outdated
